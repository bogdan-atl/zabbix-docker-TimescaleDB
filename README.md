<h1>Zabbix and PostgreSQL TSDB: An Overview and Backup/Restore Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Zabbix is an open-source monitoring software tool for diverse IT components, including networks, servers, virtual machines, and cloud services. It provides monitoring metrics, among others network utilization, CPU load, and disk space consumption. Zabbix uses a flexible notification mechanism that allows users to configure email-based alerts for virtually any event, which allows a fast reaction to server problems.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL, often simply referred to as Postgres, is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.</p>

<p>TimescaleDB (TSDB) is an open-source database designed to make SQL scalable for time-series data. It is engineered up from PostgreSQL and provides automatic partitioning across time and space (partitioning key), as well as full SQL support.</p>

<p>The advantage of using TSDB in Zabbix is that it provides improved performance for time-series data, which is a common type of data that Zabbix deals with. It also provides advanced capabilities for data retention policies and data compression, which can save storage space.</p>

<h2>Backup and Restore Guide</h2>

<h3>Backup and Restore of a Regular Database</h3>

<ol>
<li>Identify the container: sudo docker ps –a</li>
<li>Dump the database: sudo docker exec -t your_container_name pg_dump -U your_postgres_user -Fc -f /tmp/zabbix_backup.dump your_postgres_db</li>
<li>Copy from the container: docker cp your_container_name:/tmp/zabbix_backup.dump ./</li>
<li>Stop docker-compose: sudo docker-compose –f file down</li>
<li>Create a new container with postgres for database deletion: sudo docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=zabbix -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=zabbix -e POSTGRES_DB=zabbix -v $(pwd)/zbx_env/var/lib/postgresql/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:14-alpine</li>
<li>Copy the dump to the new container: sudo docker cp zabbix_backup.dump your_new_container_name:/tmp/zabbix_backup.dump</li>
<li>Delete the existing database: docker exec -i your_new_container_name psql -U zabbix -d postgres -c "DROP DATABASE zabbix;"</li>
<li>Create an empty database: sudo docker exec -i your_new_container_name psql -U zabbix -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE zabbix;"</li>
<li>Restore the database from the dump: sudo docker exec -i your_new_container_name pg_restore -U zabbix -d zabbix -1 -v -Fc /tmp/zabbix_backup.dump</li>
<li>Remove the docker container with postgres. Start docker-compose up: sudo docker-compose up</li>
</ol>

<h3>Backup and Restore of a TSDB Database</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a new container with postgresTSDB.</li>
<li>Delete the existing database and create a new one (steps 7 and 8 from the previous section).</li>
<li>Prepare the database: psql -U zabbix -d postgres, then \c zabbix</li>
<li>Run timescaledb_pre_restore to put the database in the correct state for restoration: SELECT timescaledb_pre_restore();</li>
<li>Copy the TSDB database backup into the container (step 6 from the previous section).
<li>Run timescaledb_post_restore to return the database to normal operation: SELECT timescaledb_post_restore();</li>
<li>Start Zabbix.</li>
</ol>

<p>This guide should be clear enough for people who are performing a database backup and restore for the first time. If you have any questions or run into any issues, feel free to seek further assistance from the Zabbix and PostgreSQL TSDB communities. There are numerous resources available online, including tutorials, forums, and documentation that can provide additional guidance.</p>

<p>Remember, the key to successful database management is regular backups and testing your restore procedures. This ensures that you're prepared in the event of data loss or corruption. Happy monitoring with Zabbix and PostgreSQL TSDB!</p>
